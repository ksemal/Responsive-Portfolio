      <p>Hello everyone!</p>
      <p>My name is Ksenia and I live in Holly Springs, NC. In my spare time I enjoy hiking and traveling around the world.</p>
      <p>For the first 25 years of my life I lived in Russia. But one day circumstances changed and I moved to the US with one piece of luggage and started a new part of my life.</p>
      <p>Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to learn something new. Probably, thatâ€™s why I got two degrees with different majors: in construction and graphic design. Now is time to move forward and I decided to start my journey in the web development world. And I am super excited about that!</p>
